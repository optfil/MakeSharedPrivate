Class A with private ctors declares public static method "create" which returns std::shared_ptr<A>. 
For the purpose the class defines nested struct A_shared_enabler inheriting from A. 
The only member of the latter - the ctor template - simply forwards all args to A ctor.
To have access to the private ctors the A_shared_enabler must be nested class. 
The A::create method returns shared_ptr to A_shared_enabler which is autoconverted to shared_ptr<A> due to inheritance. 
As std::shared_ptr holds actual destructor, the ~A_shared_enabler will be called.
